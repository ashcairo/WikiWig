5.0   May 2008 [fatcatair]

  Many new features and improvements.

  - Added history to wiki pages and the ability to restore from backups or the trash.

  - Made internal links immune to breakage when target pages are moved (or containing folder moved).
  - Implemented move page.
  - Added possibility of creating a new page when selecting an internal wiki link
    while editing.

  - Added selectable use of http/https for login pages.

  - Added customizable rights per user and guests.
  - Made it possible to have multiple users to have admin authority.

  - Made SMTP support an option rather than required.

  - Made user approval selectable by either, email, admin action, or automatic.
  - Added two different (optional) captcha's to the signup page.

4.3b: February 2008 [fatcatair]

  Corrected installation problems with Xinha. Extended File Manager should now
  work properly for images and document files.

  Updated localization files. English, french and german now have strings for all
  the same wiki constants. There are undoubtably still some french strings embedded in
  the code that may appear on some pages. If you see some please report it.

  Corrected problems with the Insert-Internal-Wiki-Link code. It should now properly
  show all the files in the top level directory and create proper links.

  Fixed numerous php and Javascript errors. The error log for the web server (presumably apache)
  should be much cleaner. The only error wikiwig generates that I'm aware of is:
	sh: line 1: dir: command not found

  Which is normal and harmless. It is part of the code for trying to detect safe mode.
  The browser's error console should also be much cleaner. There are some messages that
  come from Xinha code ( .css files) that are harmless and are the result of browser
  incompatibilities.

  Much reformatting of the code. I found the indentation style impossible to follow. My
  suspicion is that a lot of the code was generate by a tool as it wasn't particularly
  readable in a vanilla editor. More reformatting will come in the future.

  Properly detects safe_mode on *nix systems.

  Setup should now detect the language used in the browser/server and use that as the
  default language if the language is supported (english, french or german). If the
  language is unsupported then it defaults to french.
